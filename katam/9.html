	<blockquote>"So this is Dark Mind, the strat we are going to use is to combine for a double star"<br>- swordsmankirby</blockquote>
	
	<h3>Dark Meta Knight</h3>
	<p>Before entering the dimensional mirror, you grab stone from the bottom left switch and call friends into the room so they don't get in your way while fighting Dark Mind. You want to slide into Meta Knight so he will (most of the time) down stab, meaning he will not block (most of the time) when you use the stone attack. You want to use dash attacks so you can get multiple hits taking out a large portion of his health.</p>

	<h3>Dark Mind I</h3>
	<p>To kill Dark Mind, you drop your current ability -> pick up the master ability -> drop it on top of the previous ability to get a double star. Dark Mind is pushed in the direction of the double star which will result in a second hit killing him instantly. You need to wait until Dark Mind's eye is exposed until shooting and sometimes depending on what kind of luck you get; it is not possible to reach Dark Mind. This happens very rarely on Dark Mind I but will happen more often on later phases.</p>

	<h3>Dark Mind II Setup</h3>
	<p>One difference  here is that you want to get the double star on top of the platform. This way you can hit Dark Mind every time no matter what pattern you get.</p>

	<h3>Dark Mind III Fire / Ice</h3>
	<p>On a rare case of Dark Mind shooting a star as his attack (most of the time he will do the "waiting attack"). You can grab it and use it to create a small sequence break by using the ability to hit the switch and open the gate to Dark Mind IV. Red stars will give fire and blue stars will give ice. Purple stars will give spark which will NOT allow you to do the sequence break.</p>
