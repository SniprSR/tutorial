	<h2>King Golem</h2>
	<p>The first segment is easy to learn since it is a fairly linear path to get to the boss. You want to hit the last switch right before King Golem which will allow to to reach the rest of the bosses quickly</p>

	<h3>Gate Skip</h3>
	<p>The second room in the tutorial features gate skip. You need to time 2 precise jumps to get inside the gate before it closes. You want to try to avoid touching the higher ground to the left of the gate. If you have trouble with this, you can just press R to call friends into the room and they can hit the button for you.</p>
	
	<h3>Wheel Mix</h3>

	<p>Setting up wheel mix is not very difficult however getting wheel is a 4 frame window right in the middle of the mix. Some methods people have used to time this include counting the audible ticks in your head, looking for a certain ability on the wheel, or counting in a specific rhythm. This trick will never be 100% consistent and it takes a long long time to get used to.<br>If you miss the mix, you can go back through the door and go back in to try again. If the friend kirby's get in your way, just exit the room and Press R to call them back in there.</p>

	<h3>King Golem without wheel mix</h3>

	<p>Using Burning / Missile / Candy optimally, only loses 30 seconds. However, the missile movement is very difficult so I only reccomend doing this if you are very uncomfortable with the wheel mix or specifically trying to beat the game without mixing.</p>

	<h3>About Stone Golems</h3>
	<p>In the room before Gobbler there are two Stone Golems, you get the second one of the two because it is faster. However, the second Stone Golem has a special property where it will give a different ability depending on how it attack. This Stone Golem in particular gives Stone when standing still and moving but will give the fighter ability when doing an uppercut attack. Make sure you start sucking the Stone Golem as soon as it wakes up so you will get stone every time.</p>
