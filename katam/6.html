	<h2>Master & Crazy Hands</h2>
	<p>Master & Crazy Hands is the longest and by far the most difficult segment for a beginner. I recommend doing lots of practice here before you do your first runs. Due to the length of this segment I've decided to split it into 2 parts.</p>

	<h3>Mr. Flosty</h3>
	<p>Mr. Flosty is a fairly RNG heavy point of the run. Depending on if whether he stands still or jumps up and down, the timing to turn around wheel will be different. If you bonk you are guaranteed to get hit so this fight depends entirely on your reaction timing.</p>
	
	<h3>Candy Constellation Part 2</h3>

	<h3>Advanced Vertical Beam room strat</h3>
	<img src="img/beam.gif" style="width: 360px; height: 240px;"></img>
	<p>This strat is very difficult and getting hit will lose a lot of time because of the lag created from the ability star and beams. Recovering wheel can be very difficult sometimes so I don't recommend going for it until very consistent. This saves around a second.</p>

	<h3>Avoiding hitlag in the wheel room</h3>
	<p>The wheel room is obviously designed to be used with wheel, however you can actually save up to a second by avoiding hitlag. This is fairly difficult to do so I only recommend once you are more experienced with wheel.</p>

	<h3>Master & Crazy Hands Fight</h3>
	<p>When fighting the hands, you want to constantly jump in the air and breathe fire at them. Try to hit them both at the same time whenever possible to save time.</p>
	<p>Most of the time one of the hands will do a drop from above and the stars from the attack will give you stone. Stone doesn't save too much time, but it deals a lot of damage and makes the fight much easier.</p>

	<h3>Using ally kirbies</h3>
	<p>Depending on the abilities the ally kirbies have. It's possible to save even more time with the help of them. Several abilities to look for are <strong>Parasol, Fire, Ice,</strong> and <strong>Stone.</strong> Most other abilities will not be very useful.</p>
