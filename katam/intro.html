	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>I'm <a href="https://twitch.tv/SniprSR">SniprSR</a> and this is my guide for Kirby & the Amazing Mirror any%. This tutorial is similar to <a href="https://sk64.neocities.org/k64">swordsmankirby's Kirby 64 100% tutorial</a> where each segment is presented in several segments as opposed to one large video for the entire game. </p>
	<p>KatAM is a Metroidvania like Kirby game meaning you can beat the bosses in any order. Your goal in any% is to <b>beat all 8 bosses</b> as quickly as possible and then <b>defeat Dark Mind</b>, the final boss. The route used in this tutorial is a modified version of <a href="https://youtu.be/z3_oZa-emAE">swordsmankirby's 27:48</a>. This is the route I would recommend for beginners the most since doing segments such as Meta Knight and Moley early allows you to get a lot of the early luck out of the way. When following this general route you can do the last 3 bosses in any order. However <a href="https://pastebin.com/FjpCUJX7">there are many routes that can be used</a> before introducing the Gobbler wheel mix.</p>
	<p>If you are interested in 100%, <a href="https://sk64.neocities.org/katam/index.html">swordsmankirby's 100% guide can be found here</a></p>
