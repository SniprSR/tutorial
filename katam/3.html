	<h2>Moley</h2>
	<p>Moley is one of the shortest segments in the game. It uses stone due to how strong stone is against Bonkers. Moley is probably the most RNG heavy point of the early game which is why we do it as soon as possible in this route</p>

	<h3>Bonkers</h3>
	<img src="img/bonkers.gif" style="width: 360px; height: 240px;"></img>
	<p>The key to killing Bonkers super quickly is to hit him while in the air after sliding off the edge. This will hit Bonkers several times and you will roll away from Bonkers as a result of the speed and height. Once you are out of Bonker's hitbox, un-stone then do another fast aerial hit to finish him off. Try to get the final hit on the left side of Bonkers so he gets knocked back away from the wind tunnel, otherwise you will take an extra hit.</p>
	
	<h3>Moley with Throw</h3>
	<p>Throw is the ability used by most runners to kill Moley. It is the fastest ability and deal a good amount of damage to Moley with all attacks unless he doesn't throw anything. It is worth noting you are 100% invincible while in the throw animation. You want to hold the object Moley throws inside of Moley which will constantly deal damage.</p>
		
	<h3>Moley with Hammer</h3>
	<p>Hammer is an alternate method that loses very little time to throw when you get a perfect pattern. Some runners prefer to use hammer since you are able to attack Moley before he throws anything which can be a large timesave over getting a bad throw pattern. One disadvantage of hammer however is if Moley appears on the ceiling, hammer will do very little damage</p>
